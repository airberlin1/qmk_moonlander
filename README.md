# QMK Moonlander
My current QMK driver for a ZSA Moonlander keyboard, used to change color of some keys with theme change on PC.
This build has been adapted from my Colemak-like layout, initially changed from TheOneWhoCodes' layout [Rainbow Cake v2 (Colemak Mod DH)](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/Ze0bo/latest/0), utilising home row modifiers. 

If I remember, here you can find my current layout (with as much functionality as I could add there) on oryx:

# Build
